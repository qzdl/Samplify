* TODO
** whosampled.py
*** TODO simplify: replace manual SPACE char encoding with proper char encoding for whole query-string
** general
*** TODO add typing wherever possible
*** TODO add some critical tests
*** TODO get to 50% test coverage
*** TODO get to 80% test coverage
*** TODO get to 100% test coverage
*** TODO simplify: make config into some $HOME/$XDG_CONFIG_DIR thing
*** TODO note that this application can be used on android too
*** TODO publish to pypi
*** TODO import to guix from pypi
** backend
*** TODO refactor as platform-agnostic :backend:
use some interface abstraction for the 'platform' so similar 
ranges of actions can be built for various backends and plugged in
*** TODO refactor as input-type agnostic :ui:
so we can use spotify input, youtube/ytm input, 
..., natural language list input
*** TODO refactor as output-type agnostic  :ui:backend:
currently the input method is coupled to the output method, when 
this isn't necessary
*** TODO explore interface options (exposing samplify as OAS3.1.0 generated flask api) :ui:
currently we only have a CLI, but it might be good to have a web 
API, such that some web interface might be built. 

this might help in terms of oauth and ease-of-use for normies - such a core web 
application doesn't even really need persisted state (will rinse 
whosampled with big load though)
